# SyncVR_FinobacciNumbers-AlexFuentesRaventos

Hello again, this is my Fibonacci project. I wish you like it!


As you will see when you open the application it will have an "Studying" option available. Let's forget about that for a moment.

The button on the left is the one that let you know the next fibonacci number in the serie. If you click this repeatedly, you will can see many fibonacci numbers, until
file 7 when the text field has the limit. 
On another hand, we have the studying mode. I was thinking about SyncVR and their values, and I thaught that maybe an application that can push to learn how to sum
numbers that are icnreasing at a time you are playing, could be good. Why? Because for a person that is in a hospital, in this case is focused on a young students,  it could be interesting to challenge hiself while lerning.
In this case, a dropdown appears when you click on the button on the left , and you have to choose next number of the Fibonacci serie. The first and second number 0 and 1, appear without the dropdown.
If the player does it well, the score will increase 1 and an applause sound will be heard,if not, the score will remain the same and an error sound is reproduced.


The differents colors I choosed were thinking about neutral colors, like blue, that can't represent right or bad decision. But I draw the score in green because it is a positive thing to earn points. 

In my mind this can be one of the minigames of a big application, where some theoretical things, like Fibonacci series explanation could be explained before start the game. 
Probably, even if I get the internship position, this idea won't go anywhere, but I like to think in every project like a real one, and how to apply it in the real life.
