# SyncVR_FinobacciNumbers-AlexFuentesRaventos

Hello again, this is my Fibonacci project. I hope you like it!


As you will see when you open the application, it will have a "Studying" option available. Let's forget about that for a moment.

The button on the left is the one that lets you know the next Fibonacci number in the series. If you click this repeatedly, you will see many Fibonacci numbers, until
file 7 when the text field has the limit. 
On the other hand, we have the studying mode. I was thinking about SyncVR and their values, and I thought that maybe an application that can push to learn how to sum
numbers that are increasing at a time you are playing could be good. Why? Because, for a person in a hospital, in this case, young students,  it could be interesting to challenge himself while learning.
In this case, a dropdown appears when you click on the button on the left, and you have to choose the next number of the Fibonacci series. The first and second numbers, 0 and 1, appear without the dropdown.
If the player does it well, the score will increase one, and an applause sound will be heard. If not, the score will remain the same, and an error sound is reproduced.


The different colors I chose were thinking about neutral colors, like blue, that can't represent a right or bad decision. But I draw the score in green because it is positive to earn points. 

In my mind, this can be one of the minigames of an extensive application, where some theoretical things, like the Fibonacci series explanation, could be explained before starting the game. 
Probably, even if I get the internship position, this idea won't go anywhere, but I like to think about every project like a real one and how to apply it in real life.
