# SyncVR_FinobacciNumbers-AlexFuentesRaventos

Hello again, this is my Fibonacci project. I hope you like it!

Instructions:

In both games you will have a "Studying" options that you can accept. 

If this option is selected, when you click on the button to show the following number, a sum or a substraction appears and you have to do it correctly to sum 1 to the Score.
If you doesn't select the "Studying" option, you can see the following number of the Fibonacci serie just click on the button.

In the "SUM" option, the result of the sum is the following number of the serie. 
In the "SUBSTRACT option, the substraction have been done using two numbers already seen.

I was thinking about SyncVR and their values, and I thought that maybe an application that can push to learn how to sum
numbers that are increasing at a time you are playing could be good. Why? Because, for a person in a hospital, in this case, young students,  it could be interesting 
to challenge himself while learning.



Designing choices:

Colors: The different colors I chose were thinking about neutral colors, like blue, that can't represent a right or bad decision. But I draw the score in green because 
it is positive to earn points and "SUM" and "SUBSTRACT" buttons in red because mathmatics colors is red (That what they say...) 

Variables: I used long instead int to represent the Fibonacci numbers because with int, if the number is too long, Unity starts using the scientific notation and it 
would be weird for the kids. 

Using an array: My first idea was to only use one variable to represent all the serie, but with a list, I have a control of every of the numbers independtly so I can 
use it to create my substractions and sums as well as to write all the numbers with a space between them.

Substraction cretion:To create the substractions, I always use a bigger number first to not create negative results, that could be weird for kids.


In my mind, this can be one of the minigames of an extensive application, where some theoretical things, like the Fibonacci series explanation, could be explained 
before starting the game. 
Probably, even if I get the internship position, this idea won't go anywhere, but I like to think about every project like a real one and how to apply it in real life.
